This application computes the motion of a ball with radius $R$
and mass $m$ under the influence of gravity, air drag and lift
because of a given spinrate $\omega$. The motion starts with a
prescribed initial velocity $v_0$ making an angle initial_angle
$\theta$ with the ground. A wind velocity $w$, positive in
positive $x$ direction, can also be given.

The ordinary differential equation problem governing the
motion reads

!bt
\begin{align*}
m\frac{d^2\bm{r}}{dt^2} &= -mg\bm{j} -
\frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho A v^2\bm{i}_t +
\frac{1}{2}C_L\varrho A v^2\bm{i}_n\\
\bm{r}(0) &= 0\bm{i} + 0\bm{j}\\
\frac{d\bm{r}}{dt}(0) &= v_0\cos\theta\bm{i} + v_0\sin\theta\bm{j},
\end{align*}

where $\bm{i}$ and $\bm{j}$ are unit vectors in the $x$ and $y$
directions, respectively, $g$ is the acceleration of gravity,
$A$ is the cross section area normal to the motion, $\bm{i}_t$
is a unit tangent vector to the trajectory, $\bm{i}_n$ is
a normal vector (pointing upwards) to the trajectory,
$C_D$ and $C_L$ are lift coefficients, and $\varrho$ is the
air density. For a ball, $C_D$ is taken as 0.45, while
$C_L$ depends on the spinrate through $C_L=0.2\omega/500$.

Many numerical methods can be used to solve the problem.
In the menu one can choose between the simple
`ForwardEuler` or the 2nd- and 4th-order Runge-Kutta methods,
`RK2` and `RK4`. If the timestep `dt` is None, approximately
500 steps are used, but `dt` can also be given a desired
`float` value.

The boolean variable `plot_simplified_motion` adds the curve
of the motion without drag and lift (the standard parabolic
trajectory). This curve helps illustrate the effect of drag
and lift. When `new_plot` is `False` (unchecked), the new
computed curves are added to the previous ones since last
time `new_plot` was true.
