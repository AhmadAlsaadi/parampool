flask and django subdirectories contain specific examples used
in the tutorial. The examples, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, menu1, menu2, menu3
are constructed to have increasing complexity.

1:
Simple application with two input variables and one number as output.

2:
As 1, but output is a plot.

3:
As 2, but an extra input variable indicates whether new runs are to
be shown in the same plot or not.

4:
Full application with many input parameters. The returned HTML code
has two embedded plots and a table of results.

5:
Application with a list and filename as input to demonstrate flexible
input of an array and uploading of files.

6:
As 4, but with login and account functionality as well as storing
runs in a database.

menu1:
Example on using a menu, defined in terms of a nested list.

menu2:
As menu1, but the menu is defined through the parampool.menu.Menu
API.

menu3:
As menu2, but the programming of the menu is distributed
to different functions. Mathematical symbols for input variables
are also defined as well as more help texts and unit specifications.
