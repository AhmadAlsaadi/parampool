======= Parampool: Organization of Parameters in Trees =======

The `parampool` package is a tool administering a pool of parameters
in scientific applications. The package contains

 * a general tree data structure in Python (subpackage `tree`),
 * an application of the tree structure to menus of input parameters
   for simulation programs (subpackage `menu`),
 * tools for automatic generation of web-based user interfaces
   (subpackage `generator`), based on a menu or just a function.

With `parampool` it is very easy to equip a scientific application with
various kinds of user interfaces: graphical via web, command line,
and file input.
